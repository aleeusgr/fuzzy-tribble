# Vision Statement
Safeguarding humanity's computational knowledge for perpetuity
We preserve the algorithms, scientific models, mathematical implementations, and systematic thought encoded in software—ensuring that the intellectual achievements captured in code remain accessible to all people, for all time.

## Mission
In the spirit of the Foundation's foresight and Anna's Archive's conviction, we curate, preserve, and provide enduring access to computational knowledge. We rescue code from digital decay, corporate obsolescence, and institutional collapse, believing that every algorithm teaching us about our universe, every simulation modeling our climate, every mathematical proof formalized in silicon deserves to outlive its original context.
Core Principles (Drawing from UU values)

- Universal Access: Knowledge encoded in code belongs to humanity
- Worth and Dignity: Every contribution to computational understanding matters
- Justice and Equity: Preservation cannot favor the powerful over the essential
- Interdependence: Today's obscure library is tomorrow's critical dependency
- Free and Responsible Search: Transparency in what we preserve and why

## What We Preserve

- Scientific computing libraries and simulations
- Mathematical proofs and verification systems
- Educational code and pedagogical implementations
- Research software facing institutional abandonment
- Tools and systems documenting humanity's systematic reasoning
- The "dark matter" of computation: unsexy but critical infrastructure

## What Makes This Different
Unlike general code archives, we're curatorial and mission-driven:

- We don't just mirror—we evaluate, document, and contextualize
- We prioritize intellectual significance over popularity
- We maintain not just code, but understanding of why it matters
- We're prepared for the long haul: formats change, but knowledge endures
