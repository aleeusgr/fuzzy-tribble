# Survivor's Note: The Search for the PPK Drive

**Day 847 after the Collapse**

Found this terminal still working in the rubble of what used to be a university data center. Battery's dying, so I'll make this quick.

We're losing everything.

Not the buildings—those are already gone. Not the grid—that failed years ago. I'm talking about something more fundamental: *the knowledge of how to rebuild it all*.

## What We've Already Lost

I met a kid yesterday, maybe 19, brilliant with electronics. She can coax power from salvaged solar panels, repair circuit boards by candlelight. But she's never compiled a kernel. Doesn't know what a compiler *is*. Her generation knows how to fix what's broken, but not how to *create* from scratch.

The old folks who remember? They're dying. And their knowledge dies with them.

I've watched it happen:
- Hard drives degraded beyond recovery, taking entire software ecosystems with them
- The last person who understood IPv6 routing died in the winter of '26
- Cloud services? Gone overnight when the datacenters went dark
- GitHub, Stack Overflow, every tutorial, every forum post—evaporated like they never existed

We have machines. We have parts. What we don't have is the **bootstrap knowledge** to resurrect the computational world.

## The Dream: The PPK Drive

There's a legend among the technical survivors. A resurrection drive—the PPK Drive—supposedly built before the collapse by people who saw this coming. A Svalbard vault, but for computational knowledge.

Not just code. Not just documentation. The *complete chain* needed to bootstrap technology from first principles:

- Bootable OS that runs on scavenged hardware
- Compiler toolchains that rebuild themselves
- Network protocols from physical layer up
- Cryptography that doesn't depend on hardware we can't make anymore
- Medical databases, agricultural science, water purification designs
- The knowledge to train the next generation of engineers

Everything you'd need to resurrect information technology from zero. Self-contained. Designed to survive exactly what we're living through.

## Why This Matters

Some say it doesn't exist. That it's just wishful thinking. Maybe they're right.

But here's what I know: Right now, we're one generation away from losing the ability to rebuild. The kids growing up in this world are brilliant survivors, but they're learning to *scavenge* technology, not *create* it.

The gap between "can repair a radio" and "can design a radio" is immense. Between "can run existing software" and "can write an operating system" is even wider.

**We're not just losing conveniences. We're losing the meta-knowledge—the knowledge of how to create knowledge.**

## The Quest

So we search. Through abandoned corporate campuses. University archives. Old hacker spaces. Anywhere someone might have had the foresight to preserve computational knowledge in a durable, bootable, offline format.

Maybe we'll find the PPK Drive. Maybe we'll find something like it. Or maybe we'll realize we need to *create* it ourselves from what fragments remain.

Because the alternative—watching humanity's computational knowledge disappear into the dark—isn't acceptable.

The institutional world failed us. They were too busy moving fast and breaking things to preserve anything. They trusted the cloud, trusted "someone else's computer," trusted that things would always stay online.

**They were wrong.**

## A Message to Anyone Who Finds This

If you're reading this in some future iteration of civilization: The knowledge almost died. Maybe it did die, and you're starting from scratch. Maybe you found a resurrection drive and that's how you're reading this.

Either way: **Don't make our mistakes.**

Don't trust institutions to preserve what matters. Don't assume the internet is forever. Don't let convenience erase resilience.

Protect computational knowledge like the vital resource it is. Make it redundant. Make it durable. Make it bootable. Make it survive you.

Because someday, someone will need to bootstrap civilization again.

And they'll be searching for something like the PPK Drive.

*Terminal battery critical. Saving and shutting down.*

*If you find the drive, light a signal fire on the highest point. Three short, three long, three short.*

*We'll find you.*
