# Developer Relations Strategy: Building the Preservation Movement

## Strategic Positioning

**Core Narrative**: We're not just archiving code—we're building a grassroots movement to protect computational knowledge from institutional neglect, corporate obsolescence, and the memory hole of "move fast and break things" culture.

**Tone**: Informed urgency meets hacker ethos. Think "Internet Archive energy" + "right to repair activism" + "digital librarian punk."

## Content Pillars

### 1. **Rescue Stories** (40% of content)
*"We saved this before it disappeared"*

**Formats:**
- **Thread series**: "This Week's Rescues" - short stories of code we've preserved
- **Deep dives**: "Why This Matters" - longer posts explaining the significance of specific preserved projects
- **Before/After**: Dead links, 404s, deprecated repos → now safely preserved

**Example posts:**
- "This climate model hasn't been updated since 2015. The university shut down the lab. The PhD students moved on. But it's still cited in 47 papers. We preserved it."
- "A Fortran library for orbital mechanics, written in 1987, still more accurate than modern alternatives. It was on a dying FTP server. Not anymore."

### 2. **The Crisis** (25% of content)
*"Here's what we're losing"*

**Formats:**
- Data journalism: Stats on code decay, link rot in academic papers
- Case studies: Major scientific software that nearly disappeared
- Investigative posts: Following citation trails to dead code
- Industry critique: Vendor lock-in, planned obsolescence, paywalled knowledge

**Example posts:**
- "We analyzed 10,000 papers from Nature: 34% of cited code repositories are already gone"
- "When AWS deprecated this service, they deleted the scientific tools people built. Here's what we recovered."
- "The reproducibility crisis has a code problem"

### 3. **Community Spotlights** (20% of content)
*"Heroes of preservation"*

**Formats:**
- Maintainer interviews: People keeping old but critical projects alive
- Contributor highlights: Community members who nominate important code
- Guest posts: Researchers, librarians, archivists on preservation
- "Unsung Heroes": Profiles of unglamorous but essential software

### 4. **Educational Content** (10% of content)
*"How preservation works"*

**Formats:**
- Technical deep-dives: Our preservation methodology
- Tutorials: How to nominate/contribute
- Preservation guides: Best practices for long-term code sustainability
- "Anatomy of decay": How software dies

### 5. **Movement Building** (5% of content)
*"Join us"*

**Formats:**
- Calls to action: Nominate endangered code
- Volunteer opportunities
- Collaboration announcements
- Wins and milestones

## Platform-Specific Strategies

### **X/Twitter** (Primary: Reach & Virality)

**Frequency**: 2-3 posts/day + engagement

**Content mix:**
- Short rescue stories (thread format)
- Hot takes on code sustainability
- Real-time preservation work ("preserving now")
- Quote tweets adding context to tech industry news
- Polls: "Which endangered scientific library should we prioritize?"

**Engagement tactics:**
- Reply to discussions about reproducibility, link rot, digital preservation
- Build relationships with: academic Twitter, open source communities, digital archivists, science communicators
- Use hashtags strategically: #OpenScience #Reproducibility #DigitalPreservation #AcademicCode

**Voice**: Sharp, urgent, occasionally irreverent
*"Your startup will pivot. Your company will be acquired. Your research grant will end. But your code can outlive all of that. Let us help."*

---

### **LinkedIn** (Secondary: Institutional Credibility)

**Frequency**: 2-3 posts/week

**Content mix:**
- Longer-form thought leadership
- Data-driven posts on the preservation crisis
- Collaboration announcements with universities/institutions
- Profile pieces on contributors with impressive credentials
- Industry analysis: sustainability in scientific computing

**Engagement tactics:**
- Target: Research computing professionals, university librarians, open science advocates, institutional decision-makers
- Professional tone but mission-driven
- Connect with organizations (universities, research institutions, scientific societies)

**Voice**: Professional, data-backed, solutions-oriented
*"Research institutions invest millions in generating computational knowledge. We're ensuring that investment doesn't evaporate when the grant period ends."*

---

### **Substack** (Tertiary: Deep Engagement)

**Frequency**: Weekly newsletter

**Content structure:**
- **Weekly Rescues**: 3-5 preservation stories with context
- **Deep Dive**: One major piece (alternating themes)
  - Investigative: "We tracked down this lost software"
  - Technical: "How we preserve mathematical proof assistants"
  - Crisis: "The disappearing code crisis in climate science"
  - Community: Interview with a maintainer
- **Reading List**: Links to related preservation/sustainability discussions
- **Call to Action**: What readers can do this week

**Engagement tactics:**
- Build intimate relationship with core supporters
- Enable comments for community discussion
- Occasional open threads: "What code are you worried about losing?"
- Guest contributions from the community

**Voice**: In-depth, contemplative, narrative-driven
*Think: Molly White's "Citation Needed" meets Cory Doctorow's "Pluralistic"*

---

### **Internet Forums** (Strategic Participation)

**Target communities:**
- **Hacker News**: Share Substack posts, participate in discussions about preservation, open source sustainability
- **Reddit**: r/programming, r/compsci, r/datahoarder, r/opensource, discipline-specific subs (r/machinelearning, r/physics, etc.)
- **Lobsters**: Technical preservation discussions
- **Academic forums**: ResearchGate discussions, Twitter academic communities
- **Specialized**: Scientific computing mailing lists, domain-specific forums

**Engagement tactics:**
- Don't just promote—contribute valuable insights to existing discussions
- Share rescue stories where relevant
- Build reputation as preservation experts
- AMA opportunities: "We preserve endangered scientific code, AMA"

**Voice**: Helpful peer, technically credible, community-minded

## Sample Content Ideas

### **X Thread starters:**
"🧵 This numerical methods library was written in 1983. It's still the most accurate implementation for certain problems. The university hosting it shut down the server last month. Here's how we saved it..."

"Hot take: Every CS department should have a 'software archaeologist' the way they have archivists for physical collections."

"We just preserved a genomics tool cited in 200+ papers. None of the paper links work anymore. This is the reproducibility crisis in action."

### **LinkedIn posts:**
"The hidden cost of 'move fast and break things': institutional knowledge encoded in software is disappearing faster than we can track. Here's what we're doing about it."

### **Substack titles:**
- "The Code That Landed Curiosity on Mars Almost Disappeared. Here's How We Found It."
- "Following the Citation Trail: One Dead Link Led Us to 50 Endangered Projects"
- "Interview: The Last Person Who Understands This 40-Year-Old Climate Model"

## Voice & Messaging Guidelines

**Do:**
- Be urgent without being alarmist
- Celebrate preservation wins
- Make technical content accessible
- Show the human impact
- Call out systemic problems
- Empower the community

**Don't:**
- Shame individual researchers (attack systems, not people)
- Be preachy or self-righteous
- Use jargon without explanation
- Treat code as sacred (it's a tool for knowledge)
- Ignore failures (transparency builds trust)

**Signature phrases:**
- "We saved this before it disappeared"
- "Knowledge encoded in code"
- "Preservation is an act of optimism"
- "Your code deserves to outlive you"
